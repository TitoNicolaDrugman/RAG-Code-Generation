Query: Generate code that calculates the force from Quantum Mechanics (QM) region acting on the background Molecular Mechanics (MM) particles. The code should define a molecule using the pyscf library, generate random coordinates and charges for MM particles, and define a function to calculate the force. The force calculation should include the interaction between QM atoms and MM particles, and the interaction between electron density and MM particles. The code should then calculate the force from Hartree-Fock (HF) electron density and verify it. 

Next, the code should consider the response of HF orbitals in the analytical gradients for post-HF methods. As an example, it should use MP2 gradients to demonstrate how to include the orbital response effects in the force for MM particles. The code should define a function to make the reduced density matrix (rdm1) with orbital response, calculate the force from MP2 electron density (including orbital response), and verify it.
